Woke up in a bad place
Should probably get up so I'm not late
Stared at my phone for the past eight

Minutes at nothing, my head aches
Bottle's empty by the lampshade
I'm out of Excedrin again, great

Too early to tell, but at this rate
I'm thinkin' this might be a bad day
I walk out the bedroom, my roommate's

Asleep on the couch with her two-faced
Boyfriend who lives here, but don't pay
A penny for rent, but he still stays
